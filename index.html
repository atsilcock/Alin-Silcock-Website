            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Technical Sales Representative at Dell Technologies, where I manage 58 key accounts in the North East region across various sectors, including government, education, and healthcare. I have been in this role for over a year and a half, and I have successfully leveraged my in-depth product knowledge, communication skills, and interpersonal leadership to sell product and service benefits and the company's value proposition in a highly effective manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion is to drive progress and positive change in the world through technology, and I firmly believe that this requires valuing and empowering people. That is why I am dedicated to cultivating a workplace culture that prioritizes inclusivity, open communication, and respect for all individuals. I also proactively address unconscious bias and embrace diversity of thought, experience, backgrounds, and perspectives. By doing so, I can create a workplace environment where I can provide my customers with the best possible solutions to meet their needs.
